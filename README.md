# Rock Paper Scissors Game

### Simple implementation of the old rock paper scissors game where you play against the CPU and win points until a specified number of rounds until it decides the winner!

 > Note - This code was compiled and ran (during my school days) on [Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B) which ran a (now) discontinued version of C/C++ hence rendering this version of the code obsolete (unless of course, you run it using the Turbo C++ IDE)  
 
- On the "latest" branch I will be rewriting the same implementation compatible with latest compilers - `g++` in this case
